# INA219
INA219 Module for nRF52

This was written by a good Cortex-M4 developer that never used a nRF52.
This code was never tested.
The goal was to make something similar to https://github.com/flav1972/ArduinoINA219 but for the nRF52

Unlike the above, this version only supports one INA219 in the circuit
